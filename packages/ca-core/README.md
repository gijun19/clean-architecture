# `ca-core` ðŸš€

> Welcome to the Clean Architecture library! This project aims to provide modules that aid in the development of NodeJS services by abstracting re-usable components by layers. Projects can move towards a more modular component structure distributed across layers in your application's domain.

## Usage

```typescript
import { App, Domain, Infra, Logic, util } from `@gimli01/ca-core`;
```
